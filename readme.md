## Simple MEAN Stack App

Working off a blog [post](http://mherman.org/blog/2014/12/31/node-and-mongoose-a-primer/#project-setup) by Michael Herman on the setup of a MEAN stack app.

Note to self:

To fire this app, navigate to the directory "blog" in the console and type
```
npm start
```

This will start the express app running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
